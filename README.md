## Game Overview

**Number Guessing Game** is a multi-row interactive challenge where players attempt to guess the secret number within a limited number of tries.
Each guess provides color-coded feedback indicating whether your guesses are correct, misplaced, or incorrect.

### The game emphasizes:

- Accessibility: Clear visual cues and timed messages.
- User Experience: Smooth input handling and restart flow.
- Validation: Prevents empty, invalid, or out-of-range entries.

I chose this project to explore modular game logic, dynamic UI updates, and intuitive feedback systems as well as keeping the experience beginner-friendly and engaging.
